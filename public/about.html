<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a licensed Electronics Engineer in the Philippines and currently working as a Network Engineer.</p>
<p>I am currently a Web Development student because I want to improve my skills and earn knowledge in this field. I am also a beginner on Python programming.</p>
<p>I believe that hard work will be paid off so I must study harder :)</p>
